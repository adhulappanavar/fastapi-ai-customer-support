### 1. Problem Analysis:
Your payment was declined when trying to renew your subscription. This can happen due to various reasons such as an expired payment method, incorrect details, insufficient balance, or issues with the bank.

### 2. Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Check Payment Method:**
   - Log into your account management portal.
   - Navigate to the 'Billing' or 'Payment Methods' section.
   - Verify that the credit card or payment method on file is up-to-date and not expired.

2. **Update Payment Details:**
   - If out-of-date, select the 'Edit' or 'Update' option next to your payment method.
   - Enter your current card information, ensuring all details are correct, especially the expiration date and security code (CVV).

3. **Check Account Balance:**
   - Verify with your bank or payment provider that you have sufficient funds or available credit.
   - Check for any transaction limits that may affect your payment.

4. **Retry Payment:**
   - Go back to the subscription renewal page.
   - Attempt the payment again using the updated or verified payment method.

5. **Contact Your Bank:**
   - If the payment is still declined, contact your bank to ensure they are not blocking the transaction due to security concerns.
   - Provide them with the details of the attempted transaction, including the amount and the merchant name.

### 3. Verification:

- **Successful Renewal:**
  - Log in to your account and check if the subscription status reflects renewal.
  - You should receive an email confirmation regarding the renewal and successful payment transaction.

### 4. Alternatives:

- **Use a Different Payment Method:**
  - If problems persist with one payment method, try using another credit card or payment option if available.

- **Manual Payment Link:**
  - Contact our support team to request a manual payment link if automatic methods continue to fail.

### 5. Prevention:

- **Set Reminders:**
  - Set calendar reminders to update your payment details proactively as expiration dates approach.

- **Verify Details:**
  - Regularly check and verify your payment information within your account settings.

- **Notification Preferences:**
  - Enable notifications within your account to get alerts for payment issues or approaching expiration dates.

### 6. Knowledge Source:

- **Reference:** See our 'Billing and Subscription' section under **Payment Issues** for more detailed guidance on managing declined payments and ensuring successful transactions.

For any further assistance or if these steps do not resolve the issue, please don't hesitate to contact our support team directly.

You are experiencing an issue logging into your account after changing your password. This situation can occur due to several reasons, such as cached old passwords, typographical errors, or security settings.

---

## Step-by-Step Solution

**1. Clear Browser Cache and Cookies:**
   - Open your browser.
   - Go to `Settings > Privacy and Security`.
   - Select `Clear browsing data`.
   - Ensure `Cookies and other site data` and `Cached images and files` are checked.
   - Click `Clear data`.

**2. Verify Password:**
   - Ensure you are entering the correct new password.
   - Double-check for any typos, especially if your password is case-sensitive.
   - If you use a password manager, ensure it's updated with your new password.

**3. Use Password Reset:**
   - Go to the login page and select `Forgot Password?`.
   - Follow the prompts to reset your password again.
   - Use a strong, unique password and make a note of it in a secure place.

**4. Test Login:**
   - Return to the login page.
   - Enter your username and the newly reset password.
   - Attempt to log in again.

---

## Verification

- Successfully log into your account with the new password.
- Ensure you can access the account without being prompted for further verification steps like two-factor authentication unless it's enabled.

---

## Alternatives

- **Use Incognito Mode:** Try logging in through a private or incognito window to bypass cached data.
- **Different Browser/Device:** Attempt to log in using a different browser or device to rule out device-specific issues.

---

## Prevention

- **Keep Passwords Updated in Password Manager:** Always update your password managers with new credentials.
- **Use Strong Passwords:** Ensure your password is strong to avoid frequent resets.
- **Enable Two-Factor Authentication:** Provides an additional layer of security and can assist in account recovery.
